# Nano Custom Theme for macOS (Sequoia 15.7)

This repository contains my customized `~/.nanorc` configuration for macOS.  
It provides a clean, colorful, and productive editing experience inside the terminal.

---

## Features
- Line numbers for easier navigation  
- Mouse support (click, scroll, and select)  
- Syntax highlighting for shell, Python, JSON, HTML, CSS, and more  
- Blue title bar and magenta status bar for clear contrast  
- Works perfectly with macOS Sequoia's built-in Nano 8.2  
- Safe for Homebrew installations (`/opt/homebrew/share/nano/*.nanorc`)

## Installation

### Option 1 - Clone from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stillwrinkled/nano-theme.git
